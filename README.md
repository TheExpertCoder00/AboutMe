# 🎯 Purpose

This project was created in Grade 8 to explore and practice my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to build a simple "About Me" webpage that reflects my personality, interests, and hobbies at the time. It also serves as one of my first steps into web development and continues to represent how my interests have evolved.
