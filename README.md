I created this project in Grade 8 as a way to test and improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s a simple “About Me” website that highlights some of the hobbies and interests I had back then—and many of those are still a big part of who I am today.
This project represents one of my earliest steps into web development and serves as a personal snapshot of what I enjoyed during that time, both creatively and technically.
